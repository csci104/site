### Commit then Re-clone your Repository

Be sure to add, commit, and push your code in your {{page.hwpath}} directory to your `hw-username` repository.  Now double-check what you've committed, by following the directions below (failure to do so may result in point deductions):

1. In your terminal, `cd` to the folder that has your `resources` and `hw-username`
1. Create a `verify-{{page.hwpath}}` directory: `$ mkdir verify-{{page.hwpath}}`
1. Go into that directory: `$ cd verify-{{page.hwpath}}`
1. Clone your hw_username repo: `$ git clone git@github.com:{{site.data.urls.github_org}}/hw-username.git`
1. Go into your hw4 folder `$ cd hw-username/{{page.hwpath}}`
1. Switch over to a docker shell, navigate to the same `verify-{{page.hwpath}}` folder.
1. Recompile and rerun your programs and tests to ensure that what you submitted works.

1. Create a `verify` directory: `$ mkdir verify`
1. Go into that directory: `$ cd verify`
1. Clone your hw_username repo: `$ git clone git@github.com:{{site.data.main.github_org}}/hw-usc-username.git`
1. Go into your hw4 folder `$ cd hw-username/{{page.hwpath}}`
1. Recompile and rerun your programs and tests to ensure that what you submitted works.

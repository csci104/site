 **1**. Consider a 5-character string made up of lower-case, alpha characters, `a`-`z`.  It is known that the second and third letters are `e` and `a`, respectively, (e.g. `-ea--`) and that the letters `s` and `t` appear somewhere in the remaining locations.  How many possible such (unique) strings exist?

 **2**. Alice, Bob, and Carlos enter an elevator on the first floor in a six-story building and start going up. Any one of them can exit on any floor from 2nd to 6th, except we know that Alice definitely won't exit the elevator on the 3rd floor.  How many different events can happen? Two events are different if at least one of the three people ends up on a different floor, but if several people exit on the same floor, it does not matter in what order they do it.


 **3**. Consider that one way to categorize Pokemon cards is into water type, fire type, and all other types.
     **3.1**. You have a total 21 Pokemons, out of which 7 are water type and 5 are fire type. How many combinations of 3 Pokemon cards (the order they are selected does not matter) exist such that none of the following occur: a selection has at least two fire types and a selection has at least two water types.

     **3.2**. Your friend sends you 10 random Pokemon cards.  How many different combinations exist of their types: water, fire, and other?

 **4**. In how many ways can 4 identical copiers be used to make 6 additional copies of a document (i.e. assuming we have an original for each copier).  

 **5**. There is a Binary Search Tree with 13 nodes. Each node has a distinct value between 0 and 12. The root has value 8, and its left child has value 5. How many possible Binary Search Trees could this be?  Tip:  *Try to define how many ways there are to form a BST of 2 nodes.  Then try to define how many ways there are to form a BST of 3 nodes (think about the possible insertion order based on rank: smallest, medium, largest) **in terms of 2 node trees** for certain cases.  Continue to do this for 4 node trees (in terms of 3- and 2-node trees for various cases of insertion ordering based on rank) and 5 node trees.*

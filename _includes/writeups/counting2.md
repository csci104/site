 1. Consider a 5-character string made up of lower-case, alpha characters, `a`-`z`.  It is known that the second and third letters are `e` and `a`, respectively, and that the letters `s` and `t` appear somewhere in the remaining locations.  How many possible such (unique) strings exist?

 1. Alice, Bob, and Carlos enter an elevator on the first floor in a six-story building and start going up. Any one of them can exit on any floor from 2nd to 6th, except we know that Alice definitely won't exit the elevator on the 3rd floor.  How many different events can happen? Two events are different if at least one of the three people ends up on a different floor, but if several people exit on the same floor, it does not matter in what order they do it.

 1. You are an alien studying our Solar System. You already learned that there are 8 planets and you know their types and names: 4 rocky worlds (Venus, Mars, Earth, Mercury) and 4 gas giants (Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn). You don't know the exact order of any of the planets in terms of the distance from the Sun, but you know that (whatevet their distance) the four giant planets occupy consecutive orbits. How many different 8-planet systems (based on distance from the sun) can exist that fit these restrictions?

 1. You have a total 21 Pokemons, out of which 7 are water type and 5 are fire type. 
   
   1. How many ways are there to select 5 of the Pokemon cards (the order they are selected does not matter)?
   1. How many ways are there to select 3 of the Pokemon cards (the order they are selected does not matter) such that none of the following occur: a selection has two fire types, a selection has two water types, a selection has one water and one fire type?

 1. In how many ways can 4 identical copiers be used to make 6 additional copies of a document (i.e. assuming we have an original for each copier).  

 1. There is a Binary Search Tree with 12 nodes. Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 12. The root has value 8, and its left child has value 5. How many possible Binary Search Trees could this be?  Tip:  *Try to define how many ways there are to form a BST of 2 nodes.  Then try to define how many ways there are to form a BST of 3 nodes (think about the possible insertion order based on rank: smallest, medium, largest) **in terms of 2 node trees** for certain cases.  Continue to do this for 4 node trees (in terms of 3- and 2-node trees for various cases of insertion ordering based on rank) and 5 node trees.*

Take a moment and complete the course evaluations. They should be available via Blackboard.  Go to the home page (not for our course but for all of Blackboard) and find the tab in the upper left labelled "Course Evaluations".  Your feedback is appreciated and helps make the class better.  If there is constructive or negative feedback, consider describing an alternative approach (solution) to the problem. **Thanks!**

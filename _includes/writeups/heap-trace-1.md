You will answer several questions about Heaps in this problem.

For this problem, you must draw this by hand or using some form of drawing app and submit the results as a PDF.  Name your file `q1.pdf`.

#### Part a (3%)

Perform the `buildHeap` (aka `makeHeap`) algorithm on the following array to create a **min-Heap** from the arbitrary array shown below.  Show the state of the array as a binary tree after each iteration (call to `heapify()`) of the algorithm. (If that does not make sense review the lecture materials to review the `buildHeap` algorithm.)

- [10, 12, 3, 11, 6, 8, 9]

#### Part b (5%)

Draw the tree representation of the following *binary* Min Heap in its initial configuration, and after each operation.  Make sure to clearly indicate each of your final answers.

- Initial Configuration: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
- Insert 3

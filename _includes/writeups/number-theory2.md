1. Use the recursive patten $$x_{n+1} = (a * x_n + c) \mod m$$ to generate the first 5 pseudorandom numbers $$x_1,x_2,...,x_5$$ in the sequence given $$a=13, c=7, x_0 = -5, m = 12$$
1. How many zeros are at the end of $$100!$$
1. Prove that for any integer $$n$$, $$n^{5}-5n^{3}+4n$$ is divisible by 5.
1. Compute $$1333^{42} \mod{11}$$. 
1. Two integers $$x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$$ are said to be relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1. Use (and show the steps to) the Euclidean algorithm to determine if 309 and 112 are relatively prime.
1. Solve $$54*x + 16*y \equiv gcd(54,16)$$.  Show your work in such a way that allows the grader to recognize that you understand the relevant lecture material.
1. Find the multiplicative inverse of $$x = 33 \mod{112}$$

1. An integer from the range 00000 - 99999 is generated uniformly at random.  We are interested only in even integers that  start with 2 odd digits where all digits are unique.

1. In poker, a flush is any 5-card hand where all the cards of the same suit.  For this problem we will not distinguish between an ordinary flush and special flushes (like straight and royal flushes), meaning we will call any hand that has all 5 cards from the same suit a flush.  Poker-player Paul loves a flush.  What is the expected number of hands of poker he has to play to get a flush. (We assume each hand is dealt from a new deck containing of randomly ordered cards). 

1. A basketball team has a superstar. When their superstar plays, they win 70% of the time.  When their superstar does not play they win 50% of the time.  Entering a 5 game stretch, the superstar had been recovering from an injury and said the chance they would play the next 5 games was 75%.  You go on a trip to the jungle (no internet access). When you return you find out the team won 4 of the 5 games. What is the probability the superstar played those 5 games?  You may assume the superstar doesn't get injured during those games (either they play all or none of the 5).

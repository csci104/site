**1** Suppose a college application asks students to choose, in order, 3 of the following words that best describe them: `leader`, `innovative`, `determined`, `logical`, `outgoing`, `dreamer`, `analytical`.  A college admission officer is lazy and decides to admit any student that chooses `innovative` and `analytical` as two of the three as long as `innovative` is **before** `analytical`, **OR** if they choose `empathetic` and `innovative` (in any order).

-  **1.1** Supposing that applicants are equally likely to choose any 3 of the 7 words, what is the probability that a student will be admitted by this admission officer?

- **1.2** What is the probability that in the first 10 applications the officer reads, 4 students are admitted.

**2** Consider 4 sequential flips of a fair coin.

-  **2.1**. Let A be the event that 2 consecutive flips both yield **heads** and let B be the event that the first **OR** last flip yields **tails**.  Prove or disprove that events A and B are independent.

-  **2.2**. Let X be the random variable of how many pairs of consecutive flips (of the 4 total flips) both yield **heads**.  What is the expected value of X?

**3**. You are playing a very limited variant of the famous game WORDLE (find out the rules of this game by clicking on the question mark button here https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/)

    In your version of the game the secret answer can be only one of these words:

    ```
    NASTY
    HASTY
    BOARD
    HOARD
    MATHS
    ```

The secret word is chosen randomly (uniformly) before you start playing. You can use only words from the list as guesses.  The best starting word is the word with the smallest expected number of moves to finish the game under optimal play. You are choosing between NASTY and HASTY for a starting word. What is the expected number of moves for each of them if you play optimally?

**4**. Lewix and Zax 27.5:  A man is accused of robbing a bank. Eyewitnesses testify that the robber was 6 feet tall and had red hair and green eyes; the suspect matches this descirption.  Suppose that only 100 of the 100000 residents in the town are men who are 6 feet tall with red hair and green eyes, and assume that one of them robbed the bank.  

-  **4.1**. What is the probability that the suspect is innocent, given that he matches the description?

-  **4.2**. What is the probability that the suspect would match the description, given that he is innocent?
  
-  **4.3**. Suppose the police reviewed images of 1000 potential suspects when investigating the case, and everyone of the 100000 residents were equally likely to appear in this review.  What is the probabilty that at least one of the 1000 would match the description?

**5**. You are an astronomer studying a planetary system of a red dwarf star.
Over years of research you've discovered that for this type of star the following is true:

 - 30% of stars have 2 planets
 - 70% of stars have 3 planets
 - No star of this type has less than 2 or more than 3 planets.

There are two general types of planets: gas giants and rocky Earth-like planets that are equally abundant, i.e. if any particular planet orbiting around a star has an equal chance of being giant or rocky.   

Some exoplanets are very difficult to observe, specifically, modern telescopes have a 100% chance of detecting a giant Jupiter-like planet if it orbits around a star, but only 20% chance of detecting a rocky Earth-like planet.

After careful observation you found two giant exoplanets in the star system.
How likely is it that this star has a rocky Earth-sized planet orbiting it?

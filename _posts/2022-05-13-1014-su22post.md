We're excited to start this semester with you. Please feel free to take a look at the course schedule and syllabus.
It would be very helpful if you can start by taking a look at the labs, especially Lab 0 in which you set up your environment for course work development.  The Zoom link for lecture and recordings are available on Blackboard.

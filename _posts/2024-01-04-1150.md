title: Course Assistant

For Spring 2024, CSCI 104L is very lucky to have a staff course administrator, {{site.data.people.administrators[0].name}}, who will be the main **point of contact** for course admininstration issues (e.g. extensions, OSAS, COVID absences, exam scheduling and/or similar). 

For most issues, first use the relevant form linked on the course homepage. You can then expect a response from the course administrator.

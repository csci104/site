Thus, we are implementing a **checkpoint** for each assignment.  These are milestones in the assignment that should be relatively easy to achieve but that you must complete by a certain date (usually 4-7 days) BEFORE the full due date (to ensure you start early).  By submitting your checkpoint you earn **5 points extra credit** to be applied to your assignment, though capping at 100%.  So if you completed the checkpoint, and then got 87/100 after the HW is graded, you would be boosted to 92/100.  If you got 97/100, you'd be boosted to 100. However, You do NOT have to do the checkpoint if you so choose. You can still earn 100/100 on the HW. Your will simply keep whatever score you have earned after the grading process. Details of each checkpoint will be described in the assignment writeup.  (Note: that consistently meeting the checkpoints may also be used when weighing borderline grades or other requests).

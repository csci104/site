## Inheritance Diagram (10%)

Read the programming assignment carefully, and study the provided skeleton code.  Then, draw an inheritance diagram of all the classes in the skeleton code, as well as all of the classes you plan to create for this assignment.  As best you can, explain the reasoning for why the code is structured this way.  For example, you should explain:

1. Why do we have an abstract `Statement` class?
2. Why do we have a pure virtual `execute` function inside the `Statement` class?
3. What is the purpose of each of the classes you added?

## Inheritance Diagram (10%)

Read the programming assignment carefully, and study the provided skeleton code.  Then, draw an inheritance diagram of all the classes in the skeleton code, as well as all of the classes you plan to create for this assignment.  As best you can, explain the reasoning for why the code was structured this way.  For example, you should explain:

1. Why do we have an abstract `Product` class?
2. Given there are only two classes inheriting from `SectionParser`, was this a particularly useful application of inheritance?  Hint: think about how this program might be expanded in the future.
3. What purpose does the `DataStore` class serve, and is it related to any concepts you've learned about in lecture?

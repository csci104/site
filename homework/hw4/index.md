Consider the following initial configuration of an AVL Tree:

![AVL Tree](../img/AVLTree.jpg)

Draw the tree representation of the AVL tree after each of the following operations, using the method presented in class (when deleting, always promote a value from the right subtree...your successor).  Your operations are done in **sequence**, so your tree should have 9 values in it when you're done. Make sure to clearly indicate each of your final answers.

- Remove 10
- Insert 13
- Insert 6
- Remove 9
- Insert 14
- Remove 11

We highly recommend you try to solve these by hand before using any tools to verify your answers.

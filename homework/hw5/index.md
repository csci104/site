# HW5: Written Assignment

+ Due: Friday, April 9th, 11:59pm PST
+ You will submit this homework through Blackboard, by uploading your answers.  Please submit with a common file extension (such as .jpg, or .pdf)
+ For all your answers, you will primarily be graded on **your work**.  Only putting a final numerical answer will yield very little credit.  Instead, give the formula you used, and explain your answers.  You do **not** need to provide a final numerical answer for any of these problems, but it might help your graders out a bit if you do.

### Problem 1 (Counting, 25%)

Answer the following questions:

1. A monkey types a 280-character message on Twitter, using only the 26 upper-case English letters.  A research assistant is trying to determine if there is any hidden meaning in the message, and tries partitioning the message into 3 segments (the first x letters, the next y letters, and the last 280-x-y letters).  How many ways could the message be partitioned, assuming each segment has at least one letter?
2. How many different strings are there of length 10, made by using 10 of the letters in MISSISSIPPI?
3. How many ways can n+1 distinguishable objects be placed into n indistinguishable boxes, so that no box is empty?
4. There are 10 people in line, and each person is either a Ninja, a Pirate, or an Avenger (no single person is two of these things).  There is no more than 1 Ninja, and there is at least 1 Pirate.  How many possible lines could there be?
5. There is a Binary Search Tree with 12 nodes.  Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 12.  The root has value 9, and its left child has value 5.  How many possible Binary Search Trees could this be?

### Problem 2 (Probability, 25%)

Answer the following questions:

1. A family has 5 children, where each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.  E is the event where there are at least 3 boys.  F is the event where all children are the same gender.  Are these events independent?
2. A hash table has 10 indices, and 7 pieces of data are placed into it.  Each piece of data is assigned an index, independently of each other, and uniformly at random.  What is the probability that no two pieces of data are assigned the same index?
3. There are n jelly beans in a box of Bertie Bott's jelly beans.  Exactly one is your desired flavor (hot chocolate).  You draw one bean from the box at a time until you find your desired jelly bean.  What is the expected number of beans you draw?
5. A *triangle* in an undirected graph is a set of 3 nodes that all have edges to each other.  Let G be a graph with n nodes.  Each of the (n choose 2) possible edges exist with probability p.  What is the expected number of triangles in G?
5. Two hundred kilometers above the coast of Brazil lies the center of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) which is known to be a very hazardous zone of high energetic particles. This region exposes orbiting satellites to much higher-than-usual levels of radiation and can potentially destroy electronics onboard a satellite. Flying through the SAA, an ordinary satellite has a survival rate of 80\%. However, if the satellite has radiation-hardened (rad-hard) components, the survival rate is 97\%.  Four satellites (A, B, C, D) flew through the SAA and one of them didn't survive. Satellite D was the only one without rad-hard components.  What is the probability that satellite D was the one that didn't survive?

## Final Review

This lab will be covered during lab sections between April 23rd (Friday) - April 28th, 2021 (Wednesday). **There is no checkoff for this lab.**

The final will take place on **Wednesday, May 5th, 8 am PST**. More details will be posted on Piazza!

As with the midterms, you won't be tested on any programming tools that you've gone over in lab but not lecture (e.g. gdb, Makefiles, C++11). This lab is to help you review, so if there's a topic that's not included here that you really want to go over, let us know! Remember to go back and review lecture slides as well.

### Kahoot
We've put together a fun Kahoot to review a variety of topics! To join the game, go to [Kahoot](https://www.kahoot.it) and enter the game PIN (which your TAs/CPs will share at the beginning of lab.)

**Due at the end of your registered lab section**

---

The materials and instructions for lab2 are all available as well on [Codio](https://codio.com). Remember that from now on, unless
otherwise specified, you must get your labs checked off by a TA/CP during your registered lab section in order
to received credit.

Since this your first lab, some of you might still have trouble accessing Codio. In that case, you should let us know ASAP because
you will be submitting your homework through Codio. We also include the lab materials [here](./assets/lab-2.zip) so you may complete it.

## Final Info

### Overview and Process

- Time/Date: **{{site.data.schedule.exams[1].time}}**
  - The test will be set for **2 hours.**
  - If you have USC approved accommodations, please confirm with me via email and we will make preparations for your approved time.  
- Location: {{site.data.schedule.exams[1].location}} (leave a blank seat between you and your neighbor, if possible)
  - If you have 1.5x time accommodations: ZHS 360
  - If you have **2x or 1.5x (with other) accommodations** you should schedule your exam at the OSAS offices **for the day of the exam**

- The final will be on Gradescope
- The exam is **Closed book, Closed notes, Closed Internet (search/reference)**. You may use your mind and blank scratch paper but nothing else.
- You are allowed 1 **8.5x11 handwritten (front and back) cheatsheet**. No **typed** cheat sheets.  No **single-sided, taped** pages to form a double-sided sheet.  You will be asked to turn your cheatsheet in when you are done with the exam (so if you want it for posterity, make a copy beforehand).

- The test will be taken on a combination of paper (for problems requiring diagrams, tracing, or runtime) and Gradescope.  Gradescope can be accessed by logging into our Blackboard section, choose Assignments, and click on the Gradescope link. You will then find a **Final - Coding** assignment (once the exam begins) where you will be able to find, textboxes for some answers to certain questions and links to skeleton files and upload your completed files.  For coding questions, you will write code on your laptop and then uploading the `.cpp` file.  Skeleton files will be linked directly from Gradescope and you can download them, edit them, and upload your final code.  You can write your code in any editor and even try to compile and run if you like, but we are not expecting you do that and it will take away time from coding the other problems. We will **visually** grade your code and be fairly lenient with **small** syntax errors (e.g. a missing semicolon).  No automated tests will be provided since we don't expect you to compile and run your code.
- You will be given a paper exam that includes all questions and has room for the written answers
- The exam is **Closed book, Closed notes, Closed Internet (search/reference)**. You may use your mind, an editor and/or compiler, and blank scratch paper but nothing else. No referencing your labs, homeworks, etc.
- You are allowed 1 **8.5x11 handwritten (front and back) cheatsheet**. No **printed** cheat sheets.  No **single-sided, taped** pages to form a double-sided sheet.  You will be asked to turn your cheatsheet in when you are done with the exam (so if you want it for posterity, make a copy beforehand).

### Topics and Style

All topics covered on the midterm are also fair game in addition to the following:  

#### Unit 11 - Tree and Graph Traversals
 - Breadth- and Depth-first search
 - In-, pre-, post-order tree traversals

#### Unit 12 - Backtracking Search
 - Recursion to generate all combinations
 - General backtracking code structure

#### Unit 13 - Iterators
 - Why we use them?
 - General implementation approach (operator overloading, saving some internal state to track which item is being referenced, etc.)

#### Unit 14 - BSTs and Balanced (AVL) Binary Search Trees
 - Binary search tree property
 - BST operations: find, insert, remove and their runtimes
 - AVL tree property (using height or balance values)
 - AVL operations: insert and remove (be able to perform these yourself on paper) but you do not need to memorize the pseudocode

#### Unit 15 - Splay Trees

#### Unit 16 - Hash Tables
 - Properties of hash functions
 - Dealing with collisions
  - Closed addressing: chaining or buckets

#### Unit 17 - Counting
 - All relevant counting rules and approaches taught in lecture and on HW

#### Unit 18 - Probability
 - All relevant counting rules and approaches taught in lecture and on HW
 - Basic probability calculation
 - Conditional probability and its definition
 - Law of total probability
 - Definition of (mutual and pairwise) independence
 - Bernoulli trials and binomial distribution
 - Bayes Theorem
 - Random Variables and Expected Value
 - Linearity of Expectation
 - Geometric Distribution

#### Unit 19 - Number Theory
 - Definitions of modular congruence
 - Performing modular arithmetic
 - Modular exponentiation techniques

 - Finding multiplicative inverses for modulo-n systems

#### Unit 20 - Hash Tables, Functions, and Bloom Filters
 - One-way / cryptographic hash functions
 - Bloom filter pros and cons
 - Bloom filter operations (insert and find)

#### Unit 21- Skip Lists

#### Unit 22 - Prefix Trees and Compressed Prefix Trees

## Editors and IDEs

We strongly advise you against using gedit, notepad, or other primitive editors.
Switch to a professional-level environment or editor, such as the following:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is a commercial development environment that is generally not free, but for which you can get a free license as a USC student.
- [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) requires a CMake project to offer IntelliSense, however it is an incredibly powerful IDE that can be gotten for free as a student.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, open source IDE with good developer tooling and a wide array of plugins.

## Tutoring

- [VARC](http://viterbi.usc.edu/varc/) offers tutoring for this class.

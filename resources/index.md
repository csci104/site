Additional information will be posted here throughout the course as needed.

## Course Docker Container or VM Image

We strongly recommend you use the Docker container which will allow you to run the Linux `g++` compiler and other tools on your PC, while still maintaining your `git` repository and files on your local drive and using your favorite native editor. We recommend [Visual Code]({{ site.data.urls.visual_code }}). 

Additional info is provided in [Lab 0]({{site.url}}/labs/lab0/index.html)

 - [CS 104 Docker Repository]({{site.data.urls.docker_repo}}). Instructions are in the [README.md]({{site.data.urls.docker_repo}}/blob/main/README.md)
 - [CS 104 VM Image]({{site.data.urls.vm}})
  
## 104 Resources

- [The legacy 104 C++ guide](./guide-coding.pdf) has a bunch of useful information about how you can code for this class. 
- [The unofficial 104 textbook](./textbook-data-structures.pdf) has extensive notes on all 104 topics by David Kempe.

## Editors and IDEs

We strongly advise you against using gedit, notepad, or other primitive editors.
Switch to a professional-level environment or editor, such as the following:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is a commercial development environment that is generally not free, but for which you can get a free license as a USC student.
- [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) requires a CMake project to offer IntelliSense, however it is an incredibly powerful IDE that can be gotten for free as a student.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, open source IDE with good developer tooling and a wide array of plugins.
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) is a free IDE for C/C++, Java, and PHP.

## Tutoring

- [VARC](http://viterbi.usc.edu/varc/) offers tutoring for this class.

## Background Lectures

 - Mark Redekopp put together [several lectures](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/csmodules.html) recapping material that you should have learned in CSCI 103. These may be particularly helpful if you are a transfer student and your intro class was not as comprehensive as CSCI 103.

## MT1 Info

### Overview and Process

- Time/Date: **{{site.data.schedule.exams[0].time}}**
  - The test will be set for **1 hour, 50 minutes**
  - If you have USC approved accommodations, please confirm with me via email and we will make preparations for your approved time.  
- The test will be taken on Gradescope by logging into our Blackboard section, choose Assignmentments, and click on the Gradescope link. You will then find a **MT1** assignment where you will be able to see the questions as simple HTML or download a PDF of the questions.  The skeleton files will be downloadable (linked) from the PDF and Gradescope page.  All answers need to be entered or uploaded to Gradescope, but you may use scratch paper to work out a problem. You can write your code in an editor and even try to compile and run if you like, but we are not expecting you do that and it will take away time from coding the other problems. While it might be useful to compile, we don't recommend running and debugging unless you have time.
- The exam is **Closed book, Closed notes, Closed Internet (search/reference)**. You may use your mind, an editor and/or compiler, and blank scratch paper but nothing else. No referencing your labs, homeworks, etc.
- You are allowed 1 **8.5x11 handwritten (front and back) cheatsheet**. No printed cheat sheets.  You will be asked to submit a picture of each side on Gradescope.

### Topics and Style

The midterm will include a mix of anlaysis and coding problems.  For anlaysis problems (tracing a recursive routine, describing a class hierarchy or appropriate ADTs), you can just type your answers into Gradescope.  For coding problems you must **upload** completed `.cpp` files.

#### Unit 2a-2f - Review of CS 103 and CS 170
 - Memory allocation (when to use dynamic allocation)
 - Scope and lifetime of variables
 - Pointers, references
 - Classes (access modifiers), construction, destructions, initialization lists, use of `const` )
 - Operator overloading
 - Runtime (you'll probably want your basic series formulas on your cheat sheet)
 - Linked lists
 - Copy Constructors / Assignment Operators / Rule of 3.

#### Unit 3 - Recursion
 - Simple recursion
 - Tracing of recursive functions
 - Understanding order of execution (head vs. tail recursion)
 - Linked list recursion

#### Unit 4 - ADTS
 - List, Set, Map, Priority Queue, Queue, Stack
 - When to use each given a problem description

#### Unit 5 - STL
 - Iterators and their use
 - `std::map` usage and runtime of its operations
 - `std::set` usage and runtime of its operations

#### Unit 6 - Inheritance and Polymorphism
 - Order or construction/destruction of parent/child classes
 - Public, private, protected members
 - Public, private, protected inheritance
 - Inheritance vs. Composition relationships (`is-a` vs. `has-a`)
 - `virtual` functions (static vs. dynamic binding)
 - Abstract classes and **pure** virtual functions
 - Tracing of polymorphic code execution
 - Class hierarchy and design

#### Unit 7 - Queues and Stack
 - Implementaiton options and their effeciency
 - Applications of queues and stacks

#### Unit 8 - Templates
 - Templated classes and functions
 - Inheritance and templates
 - Function objects ("functors")

#### Unit 9 - PQ and Heaps
 - Tree representations and storage
 - Full, complete, and balanced tree definitions
 - Implementation of a priority queue
 - Heap implementation and operations (push, pop, top) and runtime
 - `build-heap` (`make-heap`) algorithm and runtime

#### Unit 10 - Graphs and Graph Algorithms
 - Graph representation (adjacency list vs. matrix, directed vs. undirected, etc.)
 - Dijkstra's algorithm
 - A* algorithm

#### Unit 11 - Tree and Graph Traversals
 - Depth-first search
 - In-, pre-, post-order tree traversals
 - Breadth-first search

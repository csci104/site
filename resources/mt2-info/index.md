## MT2 Info
Fall 2024 Canary: The following information has been updated for Fall 2024.

### Overview and Process

The exam will be **IN PERSON**!

- Time/Date: **{{site.data.schedule.exams[1].time}}**
  - The test will be set for **1 hour, 40 minutes
- Location: depends on the letter your last name starts with
  - SGM 124 Last Name Starts with A - K
  - SGM 123 Last Name Starts with L - Z
- You are allowed 1 **8.5x11 (front and back) notes sheet**. 
- You may bring a single-purpose calculator (graphing calculators okay, cell phone calculators **not** okay).  You won't necessarily need one since you should leave your answer in formula form, but if you don't know that 42 is divisible by 7, then bringing a calculator is a good idea.

### Topics and Style

The exam will cover everything through Skip Lists:

 - Counting
 - Probability
 - Number Theory
 - Hash Tables
 - Bloom Filters
 - Skip Lists

The exam is cumulative, but will have a very strong emphasis on the above material.

### Extra Practice

The following is a set of difficult practice problems.  Most of them are more difficult than you will face on the exam, but will provide extra practice on the topics of the course.

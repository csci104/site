# CSCI 104 Syllabus

The course covers the fundamentals of data structures and object-oriented programming.
They are two sides of the same coin. As a programmer becomes more proficient, they realize that how well and efficiently a problem can be solved often depends on how the data are stored.
Some of the ideas are quite sophisticated and clever, and we will explore a spectrum of them in this class, ranging from fairly basic to moderately advanced structures.

The other side is that once one realizes the importance of data structures, it is natural to think of programs not as sequences of instructions that pass around some data, but as data packets that come with the code needed to process them.
This is at the heart of the object-oriented design paradigm, and often leads to more modular and extensible (and readable) programs. We will learn about the basics of object-oriented programming, along with many of the interesting things that can be naturally done within the paradigm.

The class will put significant emphasis on a theoretical understanding of data structures, their implementation, and the object-oriented viewpoint. Assignments will contain significant programming projects along with programming-free questions to explore how data structures work.

## Learning Objectives

1. Ability to choose appropriate and efficient data structures and algorithms to solve a problem.
2. Ability to compare data structures and algorithms for efficiency using algorithm analysis and experiments.
3. Ability to apply algorithm analysis and knowledge of discrete mathematics to evaluate algorithms and data structures.

<span class="font-bold">Note</span>: due to COVID-19, Summer 2020 exams will be online and predominantly coding-based.  Unfortunately, for integrity and support reasons we cannot offer alternate time windows for the exam. You must available at the given exam time window (Pacific Daylight Time) to take the exam.  Instructions and details will be provided closer to the examinationd date for how to take the exam and submit it.

### Grading Scale

We will guarantee that you will get at least the grade indicated by the following scale.
Because of the fairly generous scale we will not round up if you are close to the lower threshold of a letter grade.
At the end of the semester, we may decide to lower the scale if the exams were more difficult than intended.

<div class="text-align-center">
  <table class="minimal center">

### Assignments, Labs, and Quizzes

Grading for [homework]({{ site.baseurl }}/homework/) and [labs]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs/) are available on their respective pages.
They contain **policies** related to grading, assignments, and policies related to submission, contesting grades, academic integrity, etc.
You are **responsible** for reading those pages *carefully* and following all of its stated policies!

### Weekly Written Exercises

While regular attendance will not be taken, class participation and attendance is **expected**.
Video recordings will be available before regularly scheduled class meeting times to help you prepare for class meetings.
During class meetings we will work on exercises in groups.
You must submit solutions to these exercises that represent your understanding of the solutions and that include the names of your collaborators.
We will discuss as many of the solutions as possible during class meeting times.
 
In addition, you must submit a question to the **weekly question bank** that will be linked on the course Piazza.
You will receive credit for completing the weekly written exercises and question bank submissions.
These will be graded Pass/No Pass (Credit/No Credit).
We will drop your lowest two scores so that you can miss two weeks of exercises and questions due to illness or other reasons without penalty.
Experience shows that attendance and participation correlate highly with success in classes!

## Attendance

While regular attendance will not be taken, class participation and attendance is **expected**.

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for the class.
We will follow the course lecture notes that you may download (and possibly print) the [lecture notes]({{ site.data.urls.notes }}).
These are based on teaching of CSCI 104 in past semesters, and cover the material quite accurately as presented in class.
However, the lecture notes may be out of order as we have changed the schedule slightly.
We will also be providing detailed lecture slides with annotations from the recorded videos on Piazza that you may also use.

We want to provide you with additional references that may enhance study and may be cited during video recordings.
In addition to the textbook used for CSCI 103, for the C++ Language the following references are available for free online from the USC Library:

## Reading Assignments

Readings from lecture notes and other sources form the base of your learning pyramid.
These readings contain theoretical concepts, examples and usable code that will be very helpful for all the work in this course.
The lecture notes and reference notes for video recordings will be provided and should be reviewed before group work during class meetings.

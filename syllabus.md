# CSCI 104 Syllabus

The course covers the fundamentals of data structures and object-oriented programming.
They are two sides of the same coin. As a programmer becomes more proficient, they realize that how well and efficiently a problem can be solved often depends on how the data are stored.
Some of the ideas are quite sophisticated and clever, and we will explore a spectrum of them in this class, ranging from fairly basic to moderately advanced structures.

The other side is that once one realizes the importance of data structures, it is natural to think of programs not as sequences of instructions that pass around some data, but as data packets that come with the code needed to process them.
This is at the heart of the object-oriented design paradigm, and often leads to more modular and extensible (and readable) programs. We will learn about the basics of object-oriented programming, along with many of the interesting things that can be naturally done within the paradigm.

The class will put significant emphasis on a theoretical understanding of data structures, their implementation, and the object-oriented viewpoint. Assignments will contain significant programming projects along with programming-free questions to explore how data structures work.

## Learning Objectives

2. Ability to compare data structures and algorithms for efficiency using algorithm analysis and experiments.

4. Ability to implement and use linear data structures, including stacks, queues, lists.
5. Ability to implement and use search structures and algorithms including binary search, search trees, and hash tables.

10. Ability to solve problems using pointers and dynamically managed memory.
11. Ability to write recursive functions and understand when recursion is appropriate to a problem.
12. Ability to design, document, and implement classes and object hierarchies.
13. Ability to apply tools and techniques for program correctness, such as unit testing, use of a symbolic debugger, and assert statements.

## Grading Weights and Scale

The following point structure will be used in determining the grade for the course. Your final grade will depend solely on your own performance, graded according to the scale given below.

<div class="text-align-center">
  <table class="minimal center">
    <thead>
      <th>Weight</th>
      <th>Item</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>35%</td>
        <td>Homework</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 5%</td>

        <td>Final Exam</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<span class="font-bold">Note</span>: due to COVID-19, Summer 2020 exams will be online and predominantly coding-based.  Unfortunately, for integrity and support reasons we cannot offer alternate time windows for the exam. You must available at the given exam time window (Pacific Daylight Time) to take the exam.  Instructions and details will be provided closer to the examinationd date for how to take the exam and submit it.

### Grading Scale

We will guarantee that you will get at least the grade indicated by the following scale. Because of the fairly generous scale we will not round up if you are close to the lower threshold of a letter grade.  At the end of the semester, we may decide to lower the scale if the exams were more difficult than intended.

<div class="text-align-center">
  <table class="minimal center">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Grade</th><th>Letter</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>85%</td><td>A </td></tr>
      <tr><td>80%</td><td>A-</td></tr>
      <tr><td>75%</td><td>B+</td></tr>
      <tr><td>70%</td><td>B </td></tr>
      <tr><td>65%</td><td>B-</td></tr>

### Assignments, Labs, and Quizzes

Grading for [assignments](/assignments/) and [labs](/labs/) are available on their respective pages.
They contain **policies** related to grading, assignments, and policies related to submission, contesting grades, academic integrity, etc.
You are **responsible** for reading those pages *carefully* and following all of its stated policies!

## Attendance

While regular attendance will not be taken, class participation and attendance is **expected**.

## Textbook

*Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++*, 6th Ed. Carrano & Henry, Pearson, 2013 (ISBN 978-0132923729)

The textbook is required.
While the class will not always follow the order or presentation style of the textbook, the textbook is an excellent source for much of the material.
Students can use older versions of the textbook if they so desire.
In that case, it is the students' responsibility to ensure that they have access to all required material.

In addition to the textbook, you should download (and possibly print) the [Lecture notes]({{ site.data.main.lecture_notes }}).
These are based on teaching of CSCI 104 in past semesters, and cover the material quite accurately as presented in class.
However, the lecture notes may be out of order as we have changed the schedule slightly.
In addition, we will post Powerpoint slides the day before lecture.
You are encouraged to print them and bring them to class with you, though none of the instructors in Fall 2017 will be using slides.
The lecture is intended as supplemental to the textbook/class notes, not a replacement; make sure to use all available resources to maximize your learning experience.

In addition to the textbook and lecture notes, we strongly recommend that each student have access to a quality book on the C++ programming language, such as the textbook used for CSCI 103.

## Reading Assignments

Readings from the book, lecture notes and other sources form the base of your learning pyramid.
These readings contain theoretical concepts, examples and usable code that will be very helpful for all the work in this course.

It is strongly recommended that students read the relevant chapters of the textbook before coming to class.
Class will proceed at a brisk pace and often be more focused on providing extra intuition and discussions rather than rehashing the book content in great detail.

## Statement on Academic Conduct

Below is USC's official language.
For more detailed information, also see the [assignments & grading page](/material/).

Plagiarism - presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words - is a serious academic offense with serious consequences.
Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in *SCampus* in Part B, Section 11, *Behavior Violating University Standards* [https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b/](https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b/).
Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable.

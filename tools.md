# Tools and Links

Additional information will be posted here throughout the course as needed.

## Extra Content

- Recorded lectures are available on [their own page](/videos/).
- Mark Redekopp put together [several lectures](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/csmodules.html) recapping material that you are expected to have learned in CSCI 103.
  These may be particularly helpful if you are a transfer student and your intro class was not as comprehensive as CSCI 103.
- The [104-specific C++ guide](http://www-scf.usc.edu/%7Ecsci104/docs/coding-guide.pdf) has a bunch of useful information about how you can code for this class. 
 
## Virtual Machines

- We recommend using Docker to virtualize your development environment.
  Instructions are available in [our repository](https://github.com/csci104/docker/){:target="_blank"}.
- If Docker doesn't work for you or you'd prefer a graphical interface, you can use the [legacy virtual machine setup](/vm/).
  Note that this includes downloading a 2.5 GB virtual image that may take several hours; try to download it overnight.

## External Resources

- [Basic Unix commands](http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/%7Eedseries/UNIXcmds.html){:target="_blank"} will improve your shell literacy, which can save you a lot of time.
- [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/){:target="_blank"} is a full-blown Unix-environment for Windows users that includes GCC, a C++ debugger, and a shell.
- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/){:target="_blank"} is a comprehensive reference of the language and standard library. 
- [cppreference.com](http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/){:target="_blank"} is a complete wiki on C++.

## Editors and IDEs

We strongly advise you against using gedit, notepad, or other primitive editors.
Switch to a professional-level environment or editor, such as the following:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-preview) is a commercial development environment that is generally not free, but for which you can get a free license as a USC student.
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is a powerful and freely available development environment, which can be used both with Java and C++.
- [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a powerful and freely available editor that is very customizable, and comes with a lot of support for writing and editing code.
  If you use Emacs, you will likely still need to know how to compile at the command line.</li>
- [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) is another powerful and freely available editor that is very customizable and has support for writing and editing code.
  Same caveat as for Emacs.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is an increasingly popular cross-platform editor.
  Not free; comes with evaluation period.

<h1>Ad-hoc tutoring for Fall 2025</h1>
<p>
  In previous semesters, Our undergraduate staff, previously known as "Course Producers" (now peer tutors or "tutors" for short) would perform ad hoc tuturing in the 2nd floor basement of Ginsburg hall.
  
  <p>However, <b>and this is an important change from previous semesters</b>, we have had severe budget cuts and there are <b>no undergraduate tutors or graders</b>.
  <p>Please use regular Office hours with either the instructors or the Graduate TAs instead.
  
  <p>We will hopefully return to peer tutoring in the future.
